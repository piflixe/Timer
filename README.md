# Timer
Timer with encoder-button and relay

I built this software to control the lamp of a photo enlarger. I used a teensy LC but I guess it can run on different boards as well.

For controlling the lamp on 230V AC power, I used a solid-state relay:

Please feel free to contribute on this project. I guess there will be many things to do better since I am not a professional programmer.

Usage
------
* Click: start / stop timer
* double click: turn lamp on
* long-press: switch between two timers
